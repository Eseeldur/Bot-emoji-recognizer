Write a bot that will respond to three groups of emoticons (joy, sadness and irritation) and give appropriate answers, taking into account the change in the emotional state of the interlocutor. Think up the bot's answers yourself.

The client sends emoticons messages.
The bot responds to the first message in a conversation with a greeting depending on the smiley face.
If the message contains text, the bot replies "I don't understand you" and resets the conversation context
The client in one message sends only one smiley from one of the groups presented. The bot should consider the context of only one previous message.

Conversation example:
Client: ðŸ˜Ÿ
Bot: Hi. Do not be sad
Client: ðŸ˜¡
Bot: You seem to get even worse
Client: ðŸ˜€
Bot: Glad you're in a good mood again!
Client: Thank youðŸ¤©
Bot: I don't understand you
Conversation is cleared
Client: ðŸ˜‚
Bot: Hi. You are very funny

Write data into two tables - a table with messages and a table with client sessions.
In the message table, the columns - message id, message time, session id, message text, client id.
In the table of sessions - session id, session start time, session end time.
The session is considered completed if there are no messages for more than 1 minute.
Linking tables by session id.

Session id - unique, changes when the context is cleared and the conversation starts
message id - unique for each message
client id - unique for each client.
